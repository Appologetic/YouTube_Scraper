# 0.0.1 (2023-06-10)
## About this version
- Search currently ignores all ads and shorts that come up on search
    - Later could add in a download if there is an ad displayed with search
    - Later could add in logic for channel/short clicks
        - For now, elected against it for simplicity for proof of concept
- Search currently displays all videos that displays on page 1 of results
    - Later could scroll a random number of times to load more videos and then search
        - Elected against this for first try, most people will likely click one of the first few results
        - Later could even weight the randomness so that first few links are more likely to be clicked
- Search currently randomly selects a video on search
    - Later could likely add some sort of thumbnail processing to select image that children would be more likely to click on, or weight these videos as more likely to be clicked
